						<h2>Yoga</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Yoga means ‘union’ or ‘connection’. In Sanskrit, the word ‘yoga’ is used to signify any form of connection. Yoga is both a state of connection and a body of techniques that allow us to connect to anything.

					Conscious connection to something allows us to feel and experience that thing, person, or experience. The experience of connection is a state of yoga, a joyful and blissful, fulfilling experience.
					Awareness is the secret of yoga.
					In Sanskrit, the word ‘yoga’ is used to signify any form of connection. In a philosophical sense, however, yoga means the conscious connection of the limited little egoic self with the unlimited, eternal, higher Self.</p>

							<p>For a yoga first-timer, a little expert advice will always come in handy. It's hard to beat face-to-face teaching in a class or gym, but, if there’s nothing available in your area, a top-quality beginners yoga DVD can be just as good. The best yoga for beginners DVD for you will be uniquely tailored to your wants and needs. Rodney Yee and Colleen Saidman have put together a Smart Start Yoga program that teaches you a range of seated and standing poses to be practiced anywhere.

							For a beginner with a hectic schedule, AM/PM Yoga for Beginners offers a sequence of gentle workouts designed to fit perfectly into the rhythms of your busy day. Yee's Yoga for Beginners includes both a shorter morning workout and a more intensive yoga routine centered entirely around accessible beginner yoga poses.</p>

								<h3>Yoga Retreats / Relaxing, Affordable, Unforgettable</h3>
							</header>
							<p>A retreat is a gift you give yourself. It is a gift of time that frees you up from your usual duties and chores so that you can rest, relax and nourish your body, your mind and your spirit.

							Yoga ou don't have to be an expert yogi, you don't need to know all the yoga postures, you don't need to be in the best shape, you don't even have to be flexible. All you need is the desire to connect to yourself and to feel centered.</p>

						<h2>Meditation</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses their mind on a particular object, thought or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Meditation may be used to reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain. It may be done while sitting, repeating a mantra, and closing the eyes in a quiet environment.
					Meditation has been practiced since antiquity in numerous religious traditions and beliefs. Since the 19th century, it has spread from its Asian origins to Western cultures where it is commonly practiced in private and business life. Meditation is under psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular research to define its possible health effects.</p>

							<p>Meditation is a journey to the depths of inner stillness and clarity. Emerging research suggests that meditation can offer benefits at the physical, cognitive and emotional levels for people who practice with some regularity. Perhaps, one of the greateset benefits of meditation is that through meditation we gain a better understanding of ourselves. As a result, we empower ourselves to establish a more meaningful relationship with ourselves and with others.</p>
